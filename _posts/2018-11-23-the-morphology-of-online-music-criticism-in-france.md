On november 23 I was in Copenhagen with my colleague Clément Bert-Erboul (a post-doc at the Data Institute) to present the first results of our research based on studying the morphology of online music criticism. We used a collection of more or less 100.000 tweets sent during the summer music festivals in France in 2018 to find out the level and reach of participants authority.
