On March 20th 2018 I participated to a scientific meeting conveyed by the Data Institute of Univ. Grenoble Alpes.
My talk — prepared with Etienne Dublé (LIG) and Sophie Kuegler (Pacte) was entitled « Who tweets (and where) ? Social, political and environmental determinants of Twitter use in France ». It intended to offer a first look at Twitter data from a sociological point of view.

We used a 32.8 M Tweets dataset. All tweets were sent from France between 2014 and 2017 with GPS geolocalisation. Every Tweet was then attributed to the IRIS zone it was sent from (+/- 2.500 inhabitants) and census (and other) data were collected to describe every IRIS. The final dataset is made of 47.484 IRIS counting at least one tweet between 2014 and 2017.

The slides of the talk are [available here for download](/pdf/Who_Tweets.pdf). You can also watch the video of the talk.
