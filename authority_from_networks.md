<b>Authority from networks ? Mapping online music criticism in France</b>

The ability of journalists to defend their professional authority in the public sphere has been challenged in many ways by the growing importance of social networks and various forms of « para— » or « ambiant » journalism produced by amateurs on platforms such as Twitter (Hermida, 2010). Cultural journalism is particularly subject to this issue as more and more people can be identified as « cultural intermediaries » (Maguire and Matthews, 2012) in the new media ecosystem driven by social networks.

This challenge has yet mostly been studied as a matter of professional and cultural autonomy for journalists. Rhetorical aspects have been widely studied such as the problem of judgement and expertise among various groups involved in the mediatisation of a given issue or the boundary work performed among traditional intermediaries to secure their jurisdiction over those issues.

In this project I provide a morphological approach of this question, attempting at a) measuring the weight of the journalistic voice as opposed to other voices dealing with the news ; b) measuring the influence and authority of that journalistic voice in the flux of interrelated people and texts that circulate on social networks.

The case study is based on a collection of +/- 200.000 tweets sent during 35 music festivals in France during the 2018 summer (covering various kinds of music : classical, jazz, pop, rock, electronic). Approximately 90.000 Twitter users have commented on those festivals during the studied period and their activity has generated more than 500.000 links on the social network (either mentions or retweets).
